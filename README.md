DeeniFriend - We a bunch of friends have developed this website. You may read, listen to, and comprehend the Al-Quran Al-Kareem in Arabic or English. There's an Arabic Quran, an English Quran, and a brief video explanation of each Juz. A Quran player to listen to any Juz of your choice. In addition, the three major Hadith books are featured in the Hadith section, and they are, of course, in english to let you understand better; you can seek the content in them depending on your area of interest. Make the most out of it insha'Allah. Make sure to follow our Instagram handle @deenifriend for amazing content. We'll be releasing more books and some other interesting stuff insha'Allah to help you further. Feel free to share it to your friends and leave suggestions through the Contact section.
