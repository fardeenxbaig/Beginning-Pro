   <p class="calibre12"> <span class="calibre6">In this chapter, you will learn how to set up the lab for hacking. So, you may have operation system like Windows, Linux or Mac OS X but for hacking you need specified operation system like Kali or Backtrack. These operation systems are created for hacking and penetration testing. They have support almost all of hacking programs. Good news, these operation systems are free. In this book, we are going to install and use Kali. These both operation systems are Linux but there are few differences. When we install Kali, there will be preinstalled programs that can be used for hacking. Maybe you think there is a problem that you must install new operation system on your computer, but there are some programs that help you virtualize operation systems. There are two famous programs called “VirtualBox” and “VMware Workstation”. We are going to use VirtualBox because it is free and it has almost same functions. VirtualBox is a free and open-source program that lets you virtualize operation systems like Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and even your own operation systems. It supports almost all operation system. So, you don’t even need to install Kali on your computer you can simply install Kali in VirtualBox and then use it as common computer. First of all, download VirtualBox latest version and install it. Here is a link available:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre12"> <span class="calibre6">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre12"> <span class="calibre6">if you are using windows operation system you should download for windows hosts binary release, if you are using Linux download for Linux operation system and if you are using Mac OS X download for it. We also need something called “Virtualbox Extention Pack”(you can find and download it from virtualbox download link), which lets us input USBs, wireless adapters and many portable devices. First install VirtualBox and then double-click extention pack and click install, installation is very easy, so I am not going to explain it. Once you have installed it, we need a Kali operation system to install on VirtualBox. But why lose time when you can simply download already installed Kali? In the Kali website, there is link to download Kali virtual images, then you can just open these virtual images on VirtualBox and start Kali. There are for VMware Workstation and for VirtualBox and you must download for VirtualBox no matter what operation system you have. Once you have finished downloading, go to the Downloads folder and search Kali virtual image, the extension must be “ova”, then double-click it and wait before process ends. If the image has sucessfully installed, look for settings button and click it. So first of all, go to the system and correctly enter ram usage for virtual machine (remember, your operation system needs at least two gb of ram), then you gonna go to the system&gt;processor and enter usage of processor, also very important is to set up network connection, because without that you will not able to do something with Kali. To do this, go to the network and choose “Bridged Adapter” this means that program will use your built-in wireless adapter. Now you are ready to start virtual machine. Click “Start” and wait before username promt appears. the default username is “root”, and default password is “toor”, but for security we going to change it later. The screen should look like this:</span> </p>
