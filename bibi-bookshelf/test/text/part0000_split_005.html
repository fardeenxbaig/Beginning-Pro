   <p class="calibre12"> <span class="calibre6">On the left side should be program called “terminal”, click on it and you will see that black screen appears with red promt “root@kali#”. You may have question like “what does root means?”, well root is an access type, to understand easly this is access when you have full access over computer, you can do anything what your computer is able to do. In windows you may think that “Administrator” is a highest level access but that is not so. Highest level access is root. This is where we going to run our commands. From terminal, you can run programs easly and do whatever you want. Our system is may out of date, so run command “apt-get update” to update system and wait until promt appears. The apt-get is a program that lets us to update system and install programs easly (we will use it often later), so with the command “apt-get update” we are calling the apt-get program and telling it to update system. Once you have updated system we need to change password because it is default, and anyone can access to it. To change password open again terminal and run command “passwd”, then it going to ask you old password, enter “toor”and click enter, and enter new password (does not metter what it will be) and remember it. So to power off virtual machine correctly click on the button to the up and right and then click on the power off sign. Now we already set up everything, and ready to learn how to hide your identify how to become untraceable.</span> </p>
